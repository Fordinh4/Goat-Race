# Goat Race Game
## Description
This is my second project about a multiplayer board game that can be played by as little as two and up to five players. 

## What is the objective of the game?

- The objective of the game is to take three out of your four goats from the Starting Gate to the Destination.  
- The first player to make three out of their four goats reach the destination wins the race.

## How to play this game?
- To refer to the positions in the board, we refer to columns using letters from A to I,and rows from 1 to 6.
- Each player receives four pieces in the shape of goats, because goats can climb on just anything, including themselves! 
- Goats can be positioned on any square, alone or stacked with other goats. These will have to be circumvented moving sideways, along the column before the obstacle

## What did I learn from this project?
- Hands-on experience with class building and encapsulation.
- Understand how classes can be used to represent complex objects, and use methods to interact with the class state.
- Realize the importance of user input validation and Exceptions.
